            <p>
              I am Nityam, currently pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering at IIT Guwahati. Originating from Patna, Bihar, my academic pursuits have instilled in me a profound enthusiasm for competitive programming and an unwavering curiosity for emerging technologies. Beyond academics, I actively engage in hockey and cricket, not only as recreational pursuits but also as avenues for personal fitness.

<br>
My proclivity for web development is another facet of my multifaceted interests. I am keen to venture into this field, drawn by its dynamic nature and its integral role in shaping the digital landscape. With a dedication to continuous learning, I aspire to seamlessly blend my engineering acumen with technological innovations, thereby contributing meaningfully to both domains.
